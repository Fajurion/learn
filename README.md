# Learn (END OF LIFE)

Learn is a platform that tries to improve learning with a friend group with large ambitions. My goal is to use it to get my degree faster and way easier. I know it might sound stupid, but we'll see if it works.

## Note
This is only a backend with no user interface. The frontend can be found in the learn-web-app repository.

## Technologies
- Spring Webflux (Reactive for max. Performance)
- Thymeleaf (Template Engine)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- R2DBC (Database Driver)
