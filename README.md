# Learn

Learn is a platform that tries to improve learning with a friend group with large ambitions. My goal is to use it to get my degree faster and way easier. I know it might sound stupid, but we'll see if it works.

## Note
This is only a backend with now user interface. There is currently no documentation for the backend, we might add one in the future.

#### Frontend
The frontend for this backend is currently still a private repository, we'll publish it when it is ready for production.

## Technologies

#### Backend
- Spring Webflux (Reactive for max. Performance)
- Thymeleaf (Template Engine)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- R2DBC (Database Driver)
